        <p><b>Dear Hiring Manager,</b></p>
        <div class="letter">
          <p>
            I am excited to apply for the Front-End Developer (Contract)
            position at Startup Launchcode. Your mission to develop robust and
            user-friendly tools resonates with my passion for crafting efficient
            and visually appealing web interfaces. With hands-on experience in
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I am eager to contribute to your
            team by delivering high-quality front-end solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my studies in Electronics and Computer Engineering at Lagos
            State University, I have honed my programming skills through
            projects that explore cutting-edge technologies. Notable examples
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>WebGL Visualization:</b> A project showcasing particle
              visualizations rendered in real-time, demonstrating the potential
              of WebGL for dynamic, data-driven visuals.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>xab:</b> A neural network training library designed to simplify
              AI model development.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>Ubject:</b> A library built in C to simulate object-oriented
              programming, emphasizing modularity and scalability.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Additionally, my role as a Laboratory Assistant has strengthened my
            problem-solving and collaboration skills. I trained students in
            programming microcontrollers, maintained adherence to technical
            standards, and worked closely with teams on project execution. These
            experiences have prepared me to contribute effectively in team
            environments while delivering results independently.
          </p>
          <p>My qualifications include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+), with a strong
              focus on responsive design and cross-browser compatibility.
            </li>

            <li>
              Experience with Git for version control and seamless team
              collaboration.
            </li>

            <li>
              A commitment to writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code
              while adhering to best practices.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to Startup
            Launchcodeâ€™s success by leveraging my skills and passion for
            front-end development. I am confident that my technical expertise,
            problem-solving abilities, and dedication to excellence align with
            your team's goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the
            opportunity to discuss how I can add value to your projects.
          </p>
